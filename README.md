myPlace is an apartment rental web application that is built by San Francisco University (SFSU) students, for SFSU students. myPlace leverages itself over its competitors by limiting its rental services to SFSU students only. myPlace will include basic features such as search, filters, maps, apartment listing, and communication. However we highlight these features by basing the design similar to official SFSU websites; thereby creating a welcoming and native feel familiar to SFSU students as well as an extension of SFSU’s online identity. By emphasizing simplicity and intuitive design, we can serve clients of all ages and focus on delivering the one desire of our SFSU students: finding a place to rent.


Guests and students shall be able to view apartment listings provided by landlords and filter results to better find exactly what they are looking for. After finding an appropriate living space, the student can contact the landlord to get more information and setup appointments.


Landlords have the ability to create apartment listings that can be seen by both guests and students. Landlords can provide information such as images, address, available times, and etc, which will allow students to better filter for their own apartment.


All postings shall be moderated by the sites administrators who can remove inappropriate or no longer relevant apartment listings. Administrators can also remove user accounts that are unproductive or toxic for the website’s community.


myPlace’s purpose is to deliver a simple and reliable apartment renting service to SFSU students. Although this type of service is not new, there has yet to be a renting service that targets SFSU students adequately. 


As a small startup of SFSU students, we believe that myPlace will not just provide a better renting service, but also foster a better relationship between SFSU students, SFSU itself, and local landlords. We know the difficulties and obstacles in finding the perfect apartment and can provide competitive resources so that each user has the best overall experience.
